1. Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify, with a single method declaration, 
a set of related methods, or with a single class declaration, a set of related types, respectively.
Generics is a technique that enriches your programs in the following ways: It helps you to maximize code reuse, type safety, and performance. 
A generic class declaration looks like a non-generic class declaration, except that the class name is followed by a type parameter section.
As with generic methods, the type parameter section of a generic class can have one or more type parameters separated by commas. These classes are known as parameterized classes or parameterized types because they accept one or more parameters.


2. Following are its benefits:
1)Type-safety : We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesn’t allow to store other objects.
2)Type casting is not required: There is no need to typecast the object.
3)Compile-Time Checking: It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime. The good programming strategy says it is far better to handle the problem at compile time than runtime.


3.The most common example is for collections such as List, Dictionary, etc. Anything which can be included as under collection.


4.Java HashSet class is used to create a collection that uses a hash table for storage. It inherits the AbstractSet class and implements Set interface.
The HashSet class extends AbstractSet class which implements Set interface. The Set interface inherits Collection and Iterable interfaces in hierarchical order.
Syntax: 
HashSet<String> set=new HashSet<String>();  


5.Difference:
1) List is an ordered collection it maintains the insertion order whereas Set is an unordered collection, it doesn’t maintain any order.
2) List allows duplicates while Set doesn’t allow duplicate elements. All the elements of a Set should be unique if you try to insert the duplicate element in Set it would replace the existing value.
3) List implementations: ArrayList, LinkedList etc. and Set implementations: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet etc.
4) List allows any number of null values. Set can have only a single null value at most.


6.Characteristics:
-->HashSet doesn’t maintain any order, the elements would be returned in any random order.
-->HashSet doesn’t allow duplicates. If you try to add a duplicate element in HashSet, the old value would be overwritten.
-->HashSet allows null values however if you insert more than one null value it would still return only one null value.
-->HashSet is non-synchronized.
-->The iterator returned by this class is fail-fast which means iterator would throw ConcurrentModificationException if HashSet has been modified after creation of iterator, by any means except iterator’s own remove method.


7.Advantage of Hash Set:
-->HashSet object can be assigned explicitly with initial capacity and load factor. The capacity gives the existing storage capability and the load factor gives increment rate of 
providing additional capacity when the existing capacity is exhausted.
--> it operates in constant time, as opposed to the O(log N) time for the Set class.



8. Since, a hashset is a collection of collection we can use it for purpose like an addressbook, employee details etc. We may also be able to use it to store details of all items in a supermarket.
